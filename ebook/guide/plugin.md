# Plugin

## Introduction
Here is a list of valid VuePress plugins that have been installed on this website, including official plugins, community plugins and niche plugins.

Especially niche plugins, because some plugins may provide relatively small demand for functions, and some customized components, the [community plugins](https://github.com/vuepress/awesome-vuepress#community-plugins) list is not necessarily included, but there may still be a small number of developers who need these plugins. Then our website may include these plugins for developers in need to consult.

Moreover, these custom developed plugins are also a new learning channel. If you have a plugin developed by yourself, you are also welcome to submit the project URL to VuePress Template [issues](https://github.com/openHacking/vuepress-template/issues), we will consider including it in the plugin list.
